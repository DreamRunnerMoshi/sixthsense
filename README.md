#This is the Java port!

Nothing has really been ported right now, but, we're working on it.

Here's what we're supposed to do:

* Port the gesture recognition to Java
* Port the setup to Java
* Port the apps to Java

Right now, everything is running on C#.NET with OpenCV, so, it will take quite a bit of time to get this ported.

To get started, there's all kinds of indentation issues in the codebase, fix those so you can get a feel for how all the code is laid out.
